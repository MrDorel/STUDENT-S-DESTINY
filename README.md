# STUDENT'S DESTINY
## This chrome extension makes it easy for you to make quick decisions when you're feeling indecisive, allowing you to maximize your work time. You input your choices, and the extension randomly chooses one of them for you! The minimalistic design makes it easy to navigate, while also minimizing the screenspace so you can be a master of multitasking.
