# STUDENT'S DESTINY
## This chrome extension makes it easy for you to make quick decisions when you're feeling indecisive, allowing you to maximize your work time. You input your choices, and the extension randomly chooses one of them for you! The minimalist design makes it easy to navigate, while also minimizing the screen space so you can be a master of multitasking. The main issue we were tasked with mending was that our teacher ran into the issue of not having a simple way of randomly selecting a student to contribute to a discussion. The reason why it needs to be a random selector is so that everyone gets a chance. This was the most fair way of going about solving this issue. Capturing multiple perspectives of input and applying that to a given situation is one of the key traits of a successful IB learner; mostly referring to the "*Open-Minded*" portion of the IB learner profile, respectively. In this modern era we need to normalize the practice of recognizing  a wider range of views from people with different cultural backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, gender, class, etc. This chrome extension is one example of how anyone can positively impact the field of computer sciences, as it is a prodominantly white and male industry. This program is a demonstration of inclusion of *everyone*. A wider range of perspectives benefits us because as developers it is our job to make our clients happy, and content. A greater amount of varied feedback is *always* better,  It is our job as the next wave of academics in this field to benefit the industry by diversifying the majority. These are the first steps.
