# STUDENT'S DESTINY
## This is a chrome extension that we created to makes it quick and easy for those who are indecisive to make quick decisions, in order to maximize your time spent working on your current project. You input your choices, and the extension chooses one of them for you! The minimalistic design makes it easy to navigate, while also minimizing the screenspace so you can be a master of multitasking.
